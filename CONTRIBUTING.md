Hello there!

I am always happy when someone takes the time to optimize published code! Rest assured, every pull request will be reviewed and considered.

Please stay on topic of the original intention that this repository follows and keep an eye of the scope of this repository. What I mean with this is, please do not add lots of objects and assets that are specific to one special use case. I try to keep the repository as-generic-as-possible.

Thanks!
